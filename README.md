React ES6
This project contains my solutions to the ES6 assignment. It demonstrates the use of modern JavaScript features such as arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, modules, spread/rest operators, and more.

To run the code, simply open the files in a browser with ES6 support or use Node.js.
